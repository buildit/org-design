## Requirements

Build a native iOS or Android app (your choice). Do not spend more than 4 hours on your solution **(even if you do not complete the entire exercise)**.
1. Give some thought to what will make a decent user experience. We would like to see something readable but with no need to go all out on sleek and flashy UI elements.
2. Use any supporting technologies, package managers, build systems, component libraries that you are familiar with and feel are appropriate.
3. Provide a README.md file that:
  - Documents how to run / build / test your creation.
  - Documents anything you might implement with more time (features, fixes, technical debt, corrections etc).
4. **The solution should be able to run locally with the appropriate simulator**.
5. Submit your code on a **public git repository** of your choice (github / bitbucket etc).

## What we are looking for

This exercise is to examine your technical knowledge, reasoning and engineering principles. There are no tricks or hidden agendas. We are looking for a demonstration of your experience and skill using current software development technologies and methodologies. Please make sure your code is clear, demonstrates good practices and that the README.md file explains how to run / build your solution. Also, detail anything further that you would like to achieve with more time. Your solution will form the basis for discussion in subsequent interviews.

For Android: Your are expected to use 
1. RxJava for network communication.
2. Clear MVP design pattern to arrange your code
3. Dependency Injection using Dagger or similar lib
4. ButterKnife
5. Write down unit test cases using mokito or similar kind of lib
