Do you think there’s something lacking in how many companies approach problems, whether they’re people, process, or technology related?

Do you want to help them figure out how to think and work differently?

Do you love technology, and understand that real change comes from people doing different things, rather than people doing the same things differently?

These are the things that drive us. Do they drive you?

### Who we are looking for

We are looking for people who want to help us change the way companies think and approach problems; people who want to work with teams and individuals who share a passion for solving complex problems; people who want to own the entire problem, whether it’s about technology, ways of working, teams, or customer experience.

We are looking for egoless people who want to be treated like adults; people who neither need, nor want, someone else to tell them what needs to be done, but instead who can look at what’s happening, what’s needed, and figure out how they fit into it; people who are comfortable finding their own place.

We are looking for people who want to work in cross-functional teams, and want to help others learn how to build them, and why they're valuable; people who understand when cloud technology is beneficial, and when it isn't; people with a grasp of a variety of technologies, languages, and methodologies, and their pros and cons.
